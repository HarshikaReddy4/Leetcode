Initialize two pointers: Initialize two pointers, slow and fast, and set both to the head of the linked list.

Traverse the linked list:

Move the slow pointer one step at a time.
Move the fast pointer two steps at a time.
Find the middle node:

Continue moving the pointers until the fast pointer reaches the end of the list.
When the fast pointer reaches the end (i.e., fast.next is null), the slow pointer will be at the middle of the list.
Return the middle node:

Return the node pointed to by the slow pointer, which is the middle node of the linked list.
