1. **Initialization**: It begins by creating a `dummyHead` node to hold the result of the sum. `tail` points to the last node of the result initially, which is the dummy head. `carry` is initialized to 0.

2. **Traversal and Addition**: It iterates through both linked lists (`l1` and `l2`) simultaneously until both lists reach their end (`null`). For each iteration:
   - It retrieves the current digits from both lists (`l1` and `l2`). If either list has reached its end, it assumes the digit to be 0.
   - It calculates the sum of the digits along with the carry from the previous step.
   - It calculates the new digit for the result by taking the remainder of the sum divided by 10 (this handles cases where the sum exceeds 9).
   - It updates the carry for the next iteration by taking the integer division of the sum by 10.
   - It creates a new node with the calculated digit and appends it to the result linked list.
   - It moves to the next nodes in both input lists (`l1` and `l2`) if they exist.

3. **Finalization**: Once both input lists are exhausted and there's no carry left, the loop ends. The `dummyHead.next` now points to the actual result of the addition. The `dummyHead.next` is disconnected from the dummy node to separate it, and then it's returned as the result.

This algorithm ensures that digits are added correctly, considering any carryovers that might occur during the addition process.
